        <p>a boymoder is a trans woman that for various reasons, social, personal, or otherwise, has decided to 
            secretly medically transition with hrt while still presenting outwardly masculine. often times this facade
            becomes apparent to others around them as hrt works its magic, while the boymoder obliviously thinks
            that they don't pass. for more information: <a href="https://boymoder.network">Boymoder Awareness Network</a>
